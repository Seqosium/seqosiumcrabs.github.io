            What are E-Bikes?
        </h2>
          <p>  E-bikes, or electric bicycles, are bicycles equipped with an electric motor and a rechargeable battery to assist with pedaling. Unlike regular bikes, which rely entirely on human power, e-bikes provide varying levels of motor assistance, making cycling easier, especially on hills or long distances.</p>
            <p>E-bikes come in different types, including pedal-assist (where the motor only activates when the rider pedals) and throttle-controlled (which can propel the bike without pedaling). The motor assistance typically stops at speeds around 20-28 mph, depending on local regulations.</p>
            <p>The main differences between e-bikes and regular bikes are the added motor, battery, and electronic controls, which increase weight and cost but enhance accessibility. E-bikes allow riders to travel farther with less effort, making them a popular choice for commuting, fitness, and recreation. While they still require pedaling, e-bikes reduce strain and fatigue, making cycling more inclusive for a wider range of riders.</p>
