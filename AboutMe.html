    <h3>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Oregon, I’m working toward my degree in psychology with a strong focus on cognitive processes and behavioral health. My ultimate goal is to attend graduate school and become a psychologist, helping people navigate their mental health challenges through therapy and research-based interventions. When I’m not buried in textbooks or correcting exams—mostly for behavioral health courses—I’m probably at home, immersed in a multiplayer game with my friends. Lately, I’ve been sinking hours into Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, chasing down massive creatures and fine-tuning strategies as part of a team. Gaming is a big part of my downtime, offering both an escape and a way to stay connected with friends. </h3>

    <h3>Outside of gaming and academics, I balance things out with plenty of physical activity. I enjoy hiking, whether it’s exploring new trails or revisiting familiar ones to clear my head. I also spend time at the gym, pushing myself to stay active and maintain a healthy routine.</h3>

    <h3>Long-term, I see myself working as a psychologist, applying what I’ve learned to help others better understand their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. Whether through research, therapy, or a combination of both, I want to contribute to the field in a meaningful way. For now, though, I’m focused on building my knowledge, honing my skills, and enjoying the journey along the way. </h3>
